This course aims to convey the nature of some of the fundamental problems in vision, and to explain a variety of techniques used to overcome them. Vision is a rapidly evolving area of computer science, and new and emerging approaches to these problems are discussed along with more ""classical"" techniques. Various vision problems are considered, including: feature detection in images, e.g. edge detection, and the accumulation of edge data to form lines; recovery of 3D shape from images, e.g. the use of a stereo image pair to derive 3D surface information; forming image mosaics; video surveillance techniques, e.g. tracking objects in video; motion detection in video images, e.g. counting number of moving objects in a video; recognising and classifying objects in images, e.g. searching a video for a particular object.

The general objective is to increase the student's mathematical awareness and problem-solving skills by discussing a variety of puzzles. The puzzle-based learning approach has a long tradition as the first mathematical puzzles were found in Sumerian texts that date back to around 2,500 BC The puzzles selected for the course satisfy most of the following criteria: a) Generality: educational puzzles explain some universal mathematical problem-solving principles;  b) Simplicity: educational puzzles are easy to state and easy to remember; c) Eureka factor: educational puzzles often frustrate the problem-solver! Eventually a Eureka! moment is reached. The Eureka factor also implies that educational puzzles often have elementary solutions that are not obvious; d) Entertainment factor: educational puzzles are very entertaining!



Such educational puzzles are used to illustrate basic concepts of critical thinking, mathematics, and problem-solving. The course presents some problem-solving rules and covers issues of understanding the problem and the role of intuition in problem-solving activities. Further, some mathematical problem-solving principles are discussed and elements of modelling, constraint-processing, optimization, probability, statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and strategy are introduced.",COMP SCI 1010 - Puzzle Based Learning,North Terrace Campus - Semester 1 - 2023,Undergraduate,,3
