Investigating, understanding, measuring and reporting the way that diseases persist and spread in populations are the first steps to reducing, controlling or eliminating the risk of ill health. All of these activities constitute the strategies used by epidemiologists to protect animal and human populations from the effects of uncontrolled diseases. Consequently, epidemiologists are the leaders of scientific teams responsible for local, regional, national or global biosecurity and for managing responses to disease outbreaks.

Familiarity with a programming language; R would be most beneficial.,"Statistical methods underpin disciplines which draw inference from data and this includes just about everything: for example, the sciences, humanities, technology, education, engineering, government, industry and medicine. Analysis of the complex problems arising in practice requires an understanding of fundamental statistical principles together with knowledge of how to use suitable modelling techniques. Computing using high-level software is also an essential element of modern statistical practice. This course provides you with these skills by giving an introduction to the principles of statistical inference and linear statistical models using the freely available statistical package R.



Topics covered are: point estimates, unbiasedness, mean-squared error, confidence intervals, tests of hypotheses, power calculations, derivation of one and two-sample procedures: simple linear regression, regression diagnostics, and prediction: linear models, analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple linear regression, factorial experiments, analysis of covariance models including parallel and separate regressions, and model building, including maximum likelihood methods for estimation and testing.",STATS 2107,Undergraduate,null,3,Statistical Modelling and Inference II,Semester 2,North Terrace Campus

Data science techniques will enhance your employability regardless of the degree you are studying. Why? Because ?big data? and advanced problem solving skills inform decision making and innovation for all organisations. Scientists are transforming the research frontier by using machine learning techniques to find Higgs bosons, classify galaxies or unravel genetic codes. Businesses are using the same techniques to identify credit card fraud, perform social network analysis and to develop automatic approaches to targeted marketing. 

In this course, you will become familiar with all major modern approaches to data science, including machine learning techniques and big data analysis strategies. Critically, students in this course will learn via an innovative and multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving. After a basic introduction to the different types of data analysis problem, students will be introduced to a variety of algorithms from the research frontier. To keep the course accessible to a broad audience, no mathematical knowledge will be assumed, and students will instead gain a hands-on, intuitive knowledge of how the algorithms work by using simple spreadsheet examples. A wide variety of problems from physics, chemistry, biology, health sciences and business will be used to encourage students to view problems through the lens of a different discipline; this will enhance your ability to spot innovative solutions to research problems in your own field. For business students, it will give you an ability to determine what your company or employer needs to remain competitive.

There will also be some discipline-specific technical training that introduces and instructs in the use of various industry-standard software packages for working with data types acquired and used by Energy Geoscience operators. Students undertaking this program typically select to specialise in this discipline in order to enter the industry sector upon graduation. 



The core skills training modules for this course concern the presentation of student work as preparation for completing future assessed components of their research project work in Semester 2 (under courses PG4020 & PG4021). These modules are: 



- Presentation Skills ? preparing students to communicate their work effectively in the form of research poster and oral Powerpoint-style presentations. These skills will be called upon in Semester 2 when students will present their research results at the SET faculty-industry research expo called Ingenuity, and when they undertake oral assessment of their research thesis work by an expert panel of academic staff during the Semester 2 examinations period. 



- Thesis Writing Skills ? preparing students to construct a properly structured and engaging scientific research thesis, the core product of their research project delivered towards the end of Semester 2. This module will follow a similar two-stage structure as is already adopted informally as part of the current program. The first stage is an interactive workshop-style session where students are introduced to the formal structure of a thesis document and its relationship to standard modes of written scientific communication. They are also introduced to various key techniques and devices that help to make their scientific writing diligent, effective, engaging and compelling. Students will also be shown various tools they can use to help with their writing, e.g. Endnote, and their time-management, e.g. Gantt charts, etc. 



- Energy resources exploration software & data skills ? industry sector-specific data and software techniques are key learning outcomes for our graduates but also provide a foundation of technical skills they will use when undertaking their Honours research project work. This module will teach students how to load, interpret and model geospatial, wireline log and seismic survey datasets. Assessment will comprise marking of exercise work assessed previously as part of courses and sub-modules that will no longer form part of the formal technical coursework program (having been part of PG4011 and PG4012 courses that are being replaced).

The Paris Agreement requires elimination of global, energy-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and this will demand a staggering transformation since 80% of current energy systems rely on the combustion of fossil fuels. This move to increasing fractions of renewable energy, including renewable hydrogen, biomass, waste and concentrated solar thermal, is driven by the need to mitigate GHG emissions and is expected to take around 50 years. The deployment of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology alongside existing fossil fuel energy production is also expected. Managing these changes brings many technical challenges, since any change in fuel composition or energy mix will influence the design of the combustion system, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. The course will equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to address these challenges. It covers the understanding, analysis and design of modern combustion systems to account for fuel properties, maximise output and minimise air pollution. Combustion involves both mixing of the fuel and oxidant and the subsequent chemical reactions. The course therefore involves consideration of both combustion aerodynamics and fuel properties.

A major factor contributing to this growth has been the development of sophisticated methods to price these products. The significance to the finance industry of developing a method for pricing options (financial derivatives) was recognized by the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Myron Scholes and Robert Merton in 1997. The mathematics upon which their method is built is stochastic calculus in continuous time. Binomial lattice type models provide another approach for pricing options. These models are formulated in discrete time and the examination of their structure and application in various financial settings takes place in a mathematical context that is less technically demanding than when time is continuous.

A major factor contributing to this growth has been the development of sophisticated methods to price these products. The significance to the finance industry of developing a method for pricing options (financial derivatives) was recognized by the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Myron Scholes and Robert Merton in 1997. The mathematics upon which their method is built is stochastic calculus in continuous time. Binomial lattice type models provide another approach for pricing options. These models are formulated in discrete time and the examination of their structure and application in various financial settings takes place in a mathematical context that is less technically demanding than when time is continuous. This course discusses the binomial framework, shows how discrete-time models currently used in the financial industry are formulated within this framework and uses the models to compute prices and construct hedges to manage financial risk.

To do this requires a knowledge of so-called ""analysis"", which in many respects is just Calculus in very general settings. The foundations for this work are commenced in Real Analysis, a course that develops this basic material in a systematic and rigorous manner in the context of real-valued functions of a real variable. Topics covered include: Basic set theory. The real numbers and their basic properties. Sequences: convergence, subsequences, Cauchy sequences. Open, closed, and compact sets of real numbers. Continuous functions and uniform continuity. The Riemann integral. Differentiation and Mean Value theorems. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Series. Power series and Taylor series.

When presented with claims in the media that are accompanied by statistics, diagrams, and outputs from technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, how can we learn to separate useful information from pseudoscience? In other words, how can we learn to not be fooled by statistics? 

The aim of this course is to improve students' data literacy, through a largely non-technical introduction to some of the foundational concepts in statistical thinking. The course will teach students from all backgrounds how to interpret and critically appraise claims made by machine learning and quantitative data science methods, and understand both the possibilities and pitfalls of these emerging sciences. It assumes no technical background and is taught largely through case studies of applications of data science outside of academia. 

The course teaches some fundamental quantitative methods for dealing with and interpreting data, as well as visualisation techniques using computer software tools such as Tableau. 

Topics include: how to translate mathematical jargon into understandable language; measuring and talking about uncertainty using probability; how to easily make clear charts and data visualisations; demystifying fundamental statistical ideas (correlation versus causation, distinguishing between significant and important results); explaining and predicting with statistical models; the ethics of data science.",MATHS 1005,Undergraduate,null,3,Critical Evaluation in Data Science,Semester 1,North Terrace Campus

The general objective is to increase the student's mathematical awareness and problem-solving skills by discussing a variety of puzzles. The puzzle-based learning approach has a long tradition as the first mathematical puzzles were found in Sumerian texts that date back to around 2,500 BC The puzzles selected for the course satisfy most of the following criteria: a) Generality: educational puzzles explain some universal mathematical problem-solving principles;  b) Simplicity: educational puzzles are easy to state and easy to remember; c) Eureka factor: educational puzzles often frustrate the problem-solver! Eventually a Eureka! moment is reached. The Eureka factor also implies that educational puzzles often have elementary solutions that are not obvious; d) Entertainment factor: educational puzzles are very entertaining!



Such educational puzzles are used to illustrate basic concepts of critical thinking, mathematics, and problem-solving. The course presents some problem-solving rules and covers issues of understanding the problem and the role of intuition in problem-solving activities. Further, some mathematical problem-solving principles are discussed and elements of modelling, constraint-processing, optimization, probability, statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and strategy are introduced.",COMP SCI 1010,Undergraduate,null,3,Puzzle Based Learning,Semester 1,North Terrace Campus

Considerable progress has been made in the mathematical modelling of fluid flows and this has greatly improved our understanding of these problems, but there is still much to discover. This course introduces students to the mathematical description of fluid flows and the solution of some important flow problems.



Topics covered are: the mathematical description of fluid flow in terms of Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates; the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations from the fundamental physical principles of mass and momentum conservation; use of the stream function, velocity potential and complex potential are introduced to find solutions of the governing equations for inviscid, irrotational flow past bodies and the forces acting on those bodies; analytic and numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation.",APP MTH 3002,Undergraduate,null,3,Fluid Mechanics III,Semester 1,North Terrace Campus

For example, the experiment of flipping a coin is best studied by treating the outcome as a random one. Mathematical probability has its origins in games of chance with dice and cards, from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. This course aims to provide a basic tool kit for modelling and analysing discrete-time problems in which there is a significant probabilistic component. We will consider Markov chain examples in the course including population branching processes (with application to genetics), random walks (with application to games), and more general discrete time examples using Martingales.



Topics covered are: basic probability and measure theory, discrete time Markov chains, hitting probabilities and hitting time theorems,  population branching processes, homogeneous random walks on the line, solidarity properties and communicating classes, necessary and sufficient conditions for transience and positive recurrence, global balance, partial balance, reversibility, Martingales, stopping times and stopping theorems with a link to Brownian motion.",APP MTH 3001,Undergraduate,null,3,Applied Probability III,Semester 1,North Terrace Campus
